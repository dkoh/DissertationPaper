%This paper provides papers with examples of the uneven class dataset. They are as below

%Classification problems with uneven distributions between classes are considered difficult problems, however %they are not uncommon in data mining projects. Problems like the detection of oil spills in satellite radar %images (Kubat et al., 1998), fraud detection in mobile communications (Fawcett and Provost, 1997) or credit %cards (Chan et al., 1999), prediction of failures in manufacturing processes (Riddle et al., 1994), and %diagnosis of rare diseases (Laurikkala, 2001), are typical examples of such problems.

%AUthors use quantile regression to assess local governments based on a set of performance indicators. They try %to match relative performance based on the upper and lower quartile. They use quantile regression to try and %model binary responses. However, they have taken a bayesian approach on quantile regression to solve for a %credible interval for the coefficients of covariates. These covariates provide insights into the reasons why %local goverments out-perform or under-perform their peers.

%This paper talks about using asymmetric bagging and asymmetric SVMs to manage the uneven dataset problem.
%The use of asymmetric SVM does improve performance of unequal datasets.

%The paper tries the following

%1. SVM is a baseline method, which uses a 2-norm soft mar- gin version of SVM.
%2. unSVM assigns different C for different classes. The parameter of balanced_bridge is set as the value of %the ratio of the number of positive examples to that of negatives which is 0.0188 in this paper.
%3. Bagging a commonly used ensemble method, which uses SVM as base learners. The number of individuals is 55.
%4. unBagging is also a commonly used bagging method, which uses unSVM as base learners. There are also 55 %indi- viduals.
%5. asBagging is asymmetric bagging which uses SVM as base learners.
%6. PPIFEAB is a bagging method, which employs feature section for asBagging to remove irrelevant and redundant %features.

%and found that PPIFEAD and asymmetric bagging performs the best

%This article discusses quantile estimation and class probabilities in logitboost and adaboost. These %algorithms were used to estimate probabilities and these probabilities are threshold to establish quantiles.  %JOUS, jittering over and under sampling with adaboost was also used. Classification with unequal cost is easy %as one has to change the cost constant of .5 to something other than the median. The authors comments that the %boosting of asymmetric classifiers must stop early as they are prone to overfitting. This is because the longer the boosting process, the more likely the classification probability either limits to 1 or 0. The method suggest that JOUS performs better than adjusting the cost.

Proposes the idea of using quantile regression to get prediction intervals for ozone levels and outlier detection.
The key difference between quantile regression forests and random forests is as follows: for each node in each tree, random forests keeps only the mean of the observations that fall into this node and neglects all other information. In contrast, quantile regression forests keeps the value of all observations in this node, not just their mean, and assesses the conditional distribution based on this information.
Quantile regression forests (QRF) is applied to various popular data sets from the Machine Learning literature and results are compared to four other quantile regression methods: linear quantile regression with interactions (QQR) and without interactions (LQR), and quantile regression trees with with piecewise constant (TRC), piecewise multiple linear (TRM), and piecewise second-degree polynomial form (TRP).

Shows evidence that mean loss is not optimal for problems that are innately asymmetric, particularly in non-linear dynamics in a data generation process leads to bias results. The current modeling of stock prices are optimal only under strict restrictions and thus the models are not robust to changing conditions such as conditional variances. The paper presents a more generalized framework to accommodate asymmetric loss in stock price modeling and states the need to create models that are more robust to deviations from the current stock forecast models.

Talks about cases where fast detection is more relevant than accurate detection.
Uses asymmetric adaboost to detect faces. Shows that asymmetric adaboosting AUC is better than regular adaboost. Also the asymmetric adaboost can be used as a speedy filter to filter through the false negative such that the dataset is vastly reduced and another more accurate trainer can be used to identify the faces.

%Tries to quantify asymmetry cost psychologically. Talks about how people rank outcomes in a relative way %instead of an absolute way. paying too much attention to a decision has lower cost than paying too little %attention. Uses stochastic dominance to
